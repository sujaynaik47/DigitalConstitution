==================== HOW NAVIGATION & RENDERING WORK ====================

1️⃣ When a nav button (e.g. “Trending”) is clicked:
    → handleNavigation(path) is called → navigate('/trending') runs.
    → This uses React Router’s useNavigate() to update the browser history
      and change the current URL path in React Router’s internal state.

2️⃣ Router detects the location change:
    → React Router updates its context (the "current location").
    → The <Routes> component inside App re-evaluates all <Route> paths.
    → It finds the matching route (<Route path="/trending" ... />)
      and renders that route’s element (<TrendingPosts />).

3️⃣ Component mounting & unmounting:
    → <TrendingPosts /> is now mounted (its function runs and JSX is rendered).
    → When navigating to another route later, it will unmount automatically.
    → This process happens only for the component inside <Routes>.

4️⃣ Why NavBar (and Footer) stay visible:
    → In App.jsx, <NavBar /> and <Footer /> are placed *outside* of <Routes>.
    → React Router only swaps the components inside <Routes>.
    → So NavBar and Footer remain mounted and persistent across pages.

5️⃣ Active button highlighting:
    → NavBar uses useLocation() to read the current path.
    → When location changes, useEffect updates currentPath.
    → The button whose path matches currentPath gets the “active” styling
      (e.g., background color changes).

6️⃣ React rendering behavior:
    → React only re-renders parts of the DOM that actually changed.
    → Since only the <Routes> output changes on navigation,
      NavBar and Footer DOM remain untouched (they’re not re-rendered).

🧠 In short:
Clicking a button → navigate('/trending') → Router updates location →
<Routes> swaps the visible page component → NavBar stays mounted the entire time.
